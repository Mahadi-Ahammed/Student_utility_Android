# Student_utility_Android
**Student Utility** is the name of the android application we created for mobile application lab project. It allows you to *take
notes, edit notes, view notes, calculate CGPA based on the student's gpa and credit, and calculate university fees with waver.*

## Design Goals/Objective
Designing a beautiful user interface is the first stage in the process. Then, we have to create four activities for each of our four primary processes, and then we take the necessary steps to complete each activity.
Our objective here is to take notes from the user, modify them, and display them. Calculate CGPA as well as tuition fees.
